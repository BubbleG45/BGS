# Changelog

All notable features and changes to BGS are logged here as they land, newest first.

## Unreleased

### Added
- Initial repo scaffold: Dart workspace with `bgs_server` (Serverpod backend), `bgs_client` (generated API client), `bgs_flutter` (app), and `bgs_web` (Jaspr public site), per [BUILD_PLAN.md](BUILD_PLAN.md).
- `bgs_web` wired to depend on `bgs_client` directly for typed calls into the Serverpod API instead of hand-rolled HTTP.
- Planning docs: [BUILD_PLAN.md](BUILD_PLAN.md), [SPORTS_ROADMAP.md](SPORTS_ROADMAP.md), [League_Platform_Pricing_Model.md](League_Platform_Pricing_Model.md).

### Fixed
- Remapped all local dev ports for `bgs_server` (18080-18091/19090-19091) and `bgs_web` (18180) off Serverpod/Jaspr defaults — this machine already runs another project on the 8080-9091 default range.
